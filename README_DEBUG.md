# How to debug tests (Github Actions)

1. You need an SSH-key registered with GitHub. You either pick the key you have already used with `github.com` or you create a dedicated new one with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 64 -f tmate_ed25519 -C "$(date +'%d-%m-%Y')"` and add it at `https://github.com/settings/keys`.

2. Add the following snippet to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *.tmate.io
    User git
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/tmate_ed25519
```
3. Go to `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/actions/workflows/tests.yml`.

4. Click the `Run workflow` button and you will have the option to select the branch to run the workflow from and activate `tmate` by checking the `Debug with tmate` checkbox for this run.

5. After the `workflow_dispatch` event was triggered, click the `All workflows` link in the sidebar and then click the `tests` action in progress workflow.

7. Pick one of the jobs in progress in the sidebar.

8. Wait until the current task list reaches the `tmate debugging session` section and the output shows something like:

```
106 SSH: ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
107 or: ssh -i <path-to-private-SSH-key> PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
108 SSH: ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
109 or: ssh -i <path-to-private-SSH-key> PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io
```

9. Copy and execute the first option `ssh PRbaS7SLVxbXImhjUqydQBgDL@nyc1.tmate.io` in the terminal and continue by pressing either <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>.

10. Start the Bats test with `bats ./tests/test.bats`.
